# inventory_project

## Purpose

Building a web application for small businesses to manage inventory with relatively minimal features
but a great ease of use. The application will handle estimated inventory by using sales and production
tables. The user can then update based on actual counts and run statistics based on estivated vs actual.

## Updating Submodules

```bash
git submodule update --remote
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
